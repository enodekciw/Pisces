Pisces is a minimal, black & white (with some shades of gray!) sharp magazine-style theme - express your thoughts in style. Pisces incorporates smart custom background images (images less than 960px will be used as a pattern, while images above 960px resolution will be displayed fullscreen) and social footer links (just add your social links to 'Social links' menu and it's done!). Furthermore, Pisces is responsive! Extra styles for post formats planned for 1.01; wplovin.com 2/12.
